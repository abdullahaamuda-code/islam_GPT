Basic Aqidah Note

1. Tawhid – Oneness of Allah
- Allah is One, without partners, children, or equals. [Quran 112:1-4]
- He alone deserves all forms of worship: dua, salah, hope, fear, reliance, sacrifice, vows, etc.
- Associating partners with Allah (shirk) is the greatest sin and is never a small issue.

2. Allah’s Names and Attributes
- Allah has beautiful Names and perfect Attributes. [Quran 7:180]
- He is All-Knowing, All-Seeing, All-Hearing, All-Powerful, Most Merciful, Most Just.
- We affirm what Allah affirmed for Himself in the Quran and authentic Sunnah without denying, twisting, or asking “how”, and without comparing Him to creation.
- Allah is completely unlike His creation. [Quran 42:11]

3. Belief in Angels
- Angels are a real creation made from light.
- They always obey Allah; they do not commit sins.
- They have many tasks: bringing revelation, recording deeds, protecting people by Allah’s permission, etc.

4. Belief in Divine Books
- Allah sent down books to His messengers: the Torah, Zabur (Psalms), Injil (Gospel), and the final revelation, the Quran.
- The Quran is the last, preserved Book, and it confirms and corrects previous scriptures. [Quran 5:48]
- The Quran has ultimate authority over earlier texts when there is any conflict.

5. Belief in Prophets and Messengers
- Allah sent many prophets to guide mankind, from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them).
- All prophets called to the same core message: worship Allah alone and avoid false gods.
- Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final messenger; there is no prophet after him. [Quran 33:40]
- The prophets are the best of creation, but they are slaves of Allah and not divine.

6. Belief in the Last Day
- There will be resurrection after death, a Day of Judgment, Paradise, and Hellfire.
- Every soul will be judged with perfect justice and mercy.
- Reward and punishment are based on faith and deeds, with Allah’s mercy above all.

7. Belief in Qadr (Divine Decree)
- Allah’s knowledge and decree cover everything: past, present, and future.
- Nothing happens except by His will, wisdom, and permission.
- People still have real choice and responsibility; they are accountable for what they decide and do.
- Proper belief in Qadr increases trust in Allah, patience, and effort, not laziness.

8. Justice of Allah
- Allah is perfectly just; He does not wrong anyone, even by an atom’s weight. [Quran 4:40]
- No one will be punished without proof and message reaching them.
- Oppression between people is forbidden; Allah will judge between His servants with complete justice.

9. Ahl al-Sunnah attitude
- The saved group is those who follow the Quran, authentic Sunnah, and the understanding of the early righteous generations of this Ummah.
- Avoid extremism, exaggeration, and takfir (declaring other Muslims disbelievers) without clear proof from Quran and Sunnah.
- Leave the detailed judging of individuals to qualified scholars; the AI should explain principles more than labelling specific persons.

10. Obedience and sin
- Believers may commit sins, but they remain Muslims as long as they do not deny what is known by necessity in the religion or commit clear major kufr.
- Major sins are dangerous and reduce faith; sincere repentance wipes them out.
- True Aqidah is shown by the heart, the tongue, and the limbs together, not words alone.

11. Sources and humility
- For creed matters, always give priority to clear Quran and authentic Hadith.
- When there is a known difference of opinion among reliable scholars, mention it briefly and avoid harshness.
- When questions go very deep or are very sensitive, it is safer to say: “This needs a real scholar who can ask you questions; please consult a trusted local scholar or fatwa center.”
