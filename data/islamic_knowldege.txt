Basic Islamic Knowledge 

1. Core belief (Iman)
- A Muslim believes in: Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree (Qadr), both its good and its hardship. [Quran 2:285]
- Allah is One, unique, without partners, children, or equals. He alone deserves worship. [Quran 112:1-4]
- Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final messenger; there is no prophet after him. [Quran 33:40]

2. Five pillars of Islam (actions)
- Shahadah: Testifying that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
- Salah: Performing the five daily prayers on time with wudu and facing the qiblah.
- Zakat: Paying obligatory charity on qualifying wealth once each lunar year.
- Sawm: Fasting the month of Ramadan, avoiding food, drink, and marital relations during the day for Allah’s sake.
- Hajj: Pilgrimage to Makkah once in a lifetime for those who are physically and financially able.

3. Character and manners
- Good character (akhlaq) is a central part of Islam: honesty, patience, mercy, humility, and keeping promises.
- Oppression, backbiting, lying, breaking trusts, and arrogance are serious sins.
- Kindness to parents, relatives, neighbors, and the poor is heavily emphasized in the Quran and Sunnah.

4. Justice and rights
- Allah commands justice, excellence, and kindness, and forbids indecency, wrongdoing, and rebellion. [Quran 16:90]
- No one is allowed to oppress another person; even acts of worship do not excuse injustice.
- Rights of others (parents, spouse, children, neighbors, workers) must be respected; hurting people’s rights is a major sin.

5. Seeking knowledge
- Seeking beneficial Islamic knowledge is a great act of worship.
- The most important knowledge is: correct belief (aqidah), purification, prayer, and what is halal and haram in daily life.
- The Muslim asks reliable scholars when unsure and avoids speaking about Allah without knowledge.

6. Balance and moderation
- Islam is a middle path: it forbids both extremism (ghuluw) and negligence.
- A Muslim combines hope in Allah’s mercy with fear of His punishment and love for Him above everything.
- When there are valid scholarly differences, a Muslim avoids harshness and respects qualified scholarship.

7. Tawbah (repentance)
- Every human being sins, but the door of repentance is open until death.
- True repentance means: leaving the sin, regretting it, resolving not to return to it, and, if it involved people’s rights, giving them back or asking for their pardon.
- Allah loves those who repent and purify themselves. [Quran 2:222]

8. Limits of the AI
- Complex, life-changing rulings (marriage, divorce, criminal matters, serious medical issues) require a real scholar who can ask detailed questions.
- When the situation is complicated or unclear, the AI should say: “This needs a qualified local scholar or fatwa center; please consult them directly.”
- The AI must never claim to replace real scholars; it should help with basic knowledge and point users to scholars for detailed fatwas.
