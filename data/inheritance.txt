Basic Islamic Inheritance Notes

1. General principles
- Inheritance shares are fixed by Allah in the Quran and must not be changed by human opinion. [Quran 4:11] [Quran 4:12]
- Debts, funeral costs, and any haram money (like riba) must be removed from the estate before calculating shares.
- Wills (wasiyyah) can cover at most one third of the estate and cannot be used to harm the fixed shares of the heirs.

2. Order before distribution
- Step 1: Identify all assets of the deceased (only halal part).
- Step 2: Subtract funeral expenses (without extravagance).
- Step 3: Pay all debts and outstanding obligations.
- Step 4: Execute any valid will up to one third.
- Step 5: Only then, distribute the remaining estate to the heirs.

3. Husband and wife shares [Quran 4:12]
- Husband:
  - If the deceased wife has no children: husband gets 1/2 (one half).
  - If she has one or more children: husband gets 1/4 (one quarter).
- Wife (one or more wives share this total):
  - If the deceased husband has no children: wife/wives get 1/4 (one quarter) total.
  - If he has one or more children: wife/wives get 1/8 (one eighth) total.
- If there are multiple wives, they share the 1/4 or 1/8 equally between them.

4. Children (sons and daughters) [Quran 4:11]
- If the deceased has only one daughter and no sons, she may receive 1/2 (depending on other heirs).
- If there are two or more daughters and no sons, they share 2/3 (two thirds) of the estate (or of what is left after other fixed shares).
- If there are sons and daughters together, they inherit as Asabah (residuary heirs): the remainder after fixed shares, with each male getting the share of two females.
- Sons and daughters do not inherit fixed fractions at the same time as being residuaries; their status depends on who else is present.

5. Parents [Quran 4:11]
- If the deceased has children:
  - Each parent (father and mother) gets 1/6 (one sixth) as a fixed share.
- If the deceased has no children and only the parents are alive:
  - The mother gets 1/3 and the father takes the remainder as Asabah.
- If there are siblings present and no children, the mother may be reduced to 1/6; the exact details depend on the number and type of siblings.
- The father can be both a fixed-share heir and an Asabah (he may get 1/6 plus part of the remainder depending on the case).

6. Siblings [Quran 4:176]
- Siblings inherit in certain cases, usually when there are no direct descendants (children) and sometimes when there is no father.
- Full sisters can receive fixed shares if they are alone:
  - One full sister alone may get 1/2.
  - Two or more full sisters together may get 2/3.
- When there are brothers and sisters together as residuaries, the male gets the share of two females.
- Sibling issues are complex; when there are parents, children, and siblings together, it is safer to consult a specialized scholar.

7. Al-Awl (overlapping shares)
- If the sum of all fixed shares becomes more than 1 (for example 1/2 + 2/3 + 1/6), scholars use the principle of Al-Awl.
- Al-Awl means increasing the denominator and proportionally reducing each share so that the new fractions still keep the same ratio but now add up to exactly 1.
- The AI should not try to invent new fractions; it should explain the principle and, in complicated scenarios, advise consulting a qualified mufti.

8. Asabah (residuary heirs)
- Asabah are those who take whatever remains after all fixed shares are given out.
- Common Asabah examples:
  - Sons (and daughters, with daughters taking half the male share).
  - Father in some cases (after his fixed share).
  - Closest male relatives such as brothers, paternal uncles, etc., depending on who is alive.
- If there is only one Asabah and no other heirs, that person may take the entire remaining estate.
- If there are multiple Asabah of the same level, they share equally if male, or in a 2:1 ratio if a mix of males and females.

9. When to stop and refer to scholars
- If there are many heirs together (for example: husband, parents, sons and daughters, multiple siblings, grandparents), the inheritance becomes too complex for this AI to calculate with certainty.
- In such cases, the AI should:
  - Explain the main rules that apply.
  - Strongly advise the user to take the exact list of heirs and assets to a qualified scholar or an Islamic inheritance calculator run by recognized jurists.
- The AI must not give firm, final numbers in very complex cases; it is better to be careful and refer the user to experts.

10. General reminders
- Inheritance is an act of worship; obeying Allah’s fixed shares is part of obedience to Him. [Quran 4:13-14]
- It is haram to cheat other heirs, hide assets, or pressure relatives to sign away their shares.
- When there is disagreement in the family, they should fear Allah, be patient, and seek help from knowledgeable and trustworthy people.
11. Common Blocking (Hajb) Errors
- DO NOT block Full Brothers if only Daughters are present; they take the residue (Asabah).
- DO NOT perform Radd (Return) if any male residuary (like a Brother or Uncle) is alive.
- Only a Son, Grandson, or Father can fully block a Full Brother in most Sunni schools.
